    Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The two projects I have posted here are our final project and an sos message. The sos project showcases my ability to learn sections of Morse code and produce said code in the form of light blips. The final project showcases the different possible outputs the program board can handle. The outputs shown are terminal display using UART, light indications, and temperature reading using I2C.

    What did you do particularly well?
I'd like to think I made my state machines very clear and easy for another programmer to comprehend and edit if needed. I also made sure to cover all possible scenarios in my state machines to avoid errors.

    Where could you improve?
I feel like I could compact my code some more, I still need to work on my loop creation to make them shorter.

    What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I'm continuing to add more code reference sites to my arsenal, along with each of these coding programs we've been using in each course.

    What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
The state machines we learned how to create in this course will be useful for any further projects I may encounter in my future courses. There wasn't much else that was new to me, it ended up being a bit of a refresher about loops.

    How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made all variable names very direct to what the variable is maintaining. The state machine is created in a way that keeps all changes and states in a very easy to understand way. The state machine should make it easy for new users to alter the effects and conditions of the different states. The interrupts are also simply setup, but could easily be made to do more.
